      <description>Enterprise applications have to be designed upfront for scalability and change. This has significant implications for both application architecture and application infrastructure. Application architecture is evolving from unmanageable monolithic or three-tier patterns to interconnected microservices. Microservices introduce new form factors not only for functionality and team-size (the so-called two-pizza teams), but also for the unit of infrastructure. It is not surprising that a portable container or a pod of handful interrelated containers often works out as the most befitting unit of infrastructure for microservices-based architecture.</description>
