	"content": " What is LunchBadger? LunchBadger is a microservices platform that developers and devops engineers can use to build microservices, deploy them to any cloud, and expose them as APIs for consumption.\nWhy would I want to use LunchBadger? Time. You\u0026rsquo;ll save massive amounts of time trying to attain the benefits of a microservices architecture. LunchBadger provides the following to repeatedly save you time:\n best practices for microservices built into the tool code scaffolding and built in boilerplates automated real time deployment to the cloud(s) of your choice visual orchestration and wiring of microservices to an API gateway, data sources, and more  How does LunchBadger Work? LunchBadger is driven by a GUI known as the [Canvas]. The Canvas guides user in the process of building, deploying, and managing microservices and exposing them as APIs.\nLunchBadger utilizes the best of breed open source projects for easy adoption, constant innovation and specialization of what each component brings to putting together a holistic microservices platform.\nSource-level access to these components provides opportunities in portability and environment-specific testing. Here are the main projects used behind the scenes and integrated into LunchBadger:\n Express Gateway - an API gateway to expose microservices by defining them as service endpoints and exposing them as API endpoints externally LoopBackJS - a Node.js based framework that lets you create microservices using a model driven approach Serverless - a cloud agnostic framework that Acts as an adapter to serverless (a.k.a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)) platforms. Kubeless - A Kubernetes native serverless engine that allows you to write functions in many supported languages Kubernetes - a container orchestrator that runs in any cloud that deploys microservices as they are built in LunchBadger ReactJS - a GUI framework that allows you to extend and build on top of LunchBadger\u0026rsquo;s visual interface  Interested in our open source project, Express Gateway? If youâ€™d like to contribute, please see our Github website repo or you can join our Community on Gitter. [Commercial Support options are also available for Express Gateway. ] [ Link to support page when ready]\nNeed Support? Now that you\u0026rsquo;re armed with the basics of how to use LunchBadger, have fun!

	"content": "Connectors are prebuilt libraries that allow you to utlize a wide array of popular data sources and services. At this time, Connectors can be directly utilzed by Models only by connecting the Connector port to the left Model port.\nEach connector entity will come with its own set of properties specific for that type of connection.\nConnectors in LunchBadger are based on LoopBack data sources and their corresponding connectors\n LunchBadger comes with the following connectors:\n Memory REST SOAP MongoDB Redis MySQL PostgreSQL Etherum Salesforce Triton Object Storage  LunchBadger provides a graphical interface for the LoopBack based connectors listed above. Any LoopBack connector can be utilized by LunchBadger.\n "

	"content": " The LunchBadger platform Canvas is a single pane of glass where you can design, build and create your microservices and APIs.\n The Canvas is broken up into a few easy parts to understand:\n the entity palettte quadrants panels  Entity Palette The left most toolbar is called the Entity Palette. Each icon in the palette represents a different entity that you can create. The entity palette is divided up into different entity types.\nSome entities are used when you are developing your microservcies and integrating to existing data and application. Others are used when you want to expose microservices as APIs and secure them through an API gateway. More Details: Entity Palette\nQuadrants Quadrants represent different tiers within your application. They are designed to help you logically classify the different parts of your application in a microservices architecture.\nBackend The backend quadrant represents where you data and services exist and or persisted. Microservices can be built on top of existing legacy applications and or data.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no need to throw away your old applications as you move into a microservices architecture. LunchBadger has tooling to help you create a new layer of microservices on top of your old applications. This will allow you to build entirely new microservices alongside microservices that sit as a layer on top of legacy.\n LunchBadger utilizes the same tooling to connect to new data sources where you want to persist data utilized with new microserivces.\nExample:\n You have data in MySQL that exists as rows and tables and you want to create a set of microservices that represent that data. A MySQL connector can be created in the backend quadrant and represents a connection to MySQL as a legacy data source.\n Example:\n You are creating a new microservice that handles payments. The microservices requires each payment performed to be recorded with transaction details as a JSON object. A MongoDB connector can be created in the backend quadrant that represents the connection to new MongoDB instance that will store the new transaction data.\n Private The private quadrant represents all business functionality within your application. This quadrant contains all models, service endpoints and functions in your system. They are not exposed publically, but can communicate with each other. In LunchBadger communication with external services is done through the Gateway\nExample:\n You have a legacy SOAP service that represents a customer. The customer SOAP object has 100 properties. You want to surface a new credit application API backed by a model based microservcie that only requires 10 of the 100 fields that are minimally needed for a new customer applying for credit. A customer microsevice model can be created with the 10 fields that are required connecte to an instance of the SOAP connector in the backend quadrant pointed to the legacy SOAP service.\n Example:\n You have a function that calculates\n Gateway Hosted Express-Gateway that provides routing, authentication, authorization, rate-limiting etc. for private endpoints More details about Gateways\nPublic A section for Api Endpoints. They define how incoming(ingress) traffic is routed to the Gateways\n"

Models can be connected to data sources and services through a Connector.\n API Management Entities API Management entities include:\n Gateways - a microgateway that secures and manages your microservices and exposes them as consumable APIs Service Endpoints - any internal endpoint that the API Gateway proxies in front of API Endpoints - externalized endpoints that are exposed by the API Gateway to be consumed as an API by a client  "
